#  Telegram sticker downloading bot
## Preamble
Scenario: You want to download a Telegram sticker.
You _could_ use @Stickerdownloadbot, except...

 - It can be extremely slow at times
 - It will occasionally spam you with invites to the funny channel
 - There's no other well known sticker downloading bots
 
Introducing: _My first NodeJS show-and-tell project!_
Yeah.. That's pretty much the reason why I made this. It's about time I get into Node.

## Live bot
I'm currently hosting this code on [@DownloadADamnSticker_Bot](https://t.me/DownloadADamnSticker_Bot) so feel free to give it a try!

## How-to
To get this thing up and running, install dependencies with `npm install` add your bot token in the first line of tg-sticker.js then run it. Pretty simple.
